Security and Audit Protocol for Decentralized oracles on chainlink. Ensuring security of external data from off-chain solutions to blockchain. 


Inbuilt reputation  bidding system and a decentralised network that relies on independent oracle service providers, users can ensure their data is trustworthy as it’s verified by multiple independent sources. It helped to safeguard against reputation farming, Sybil attacks

Other Decentralized Oracle Networks such as Chainlink often said as a Decentralized JSON Parser. SAA protocol instead help CYC and Hash functions to ensure data integrity in the code.

Lets take an example of a  football match the data coming from some of the oracles regarding the result is different, and there’s a huge discrepancy in scores. Some oracles are saying that your team won the match, and some are saying the opposite. In the case of a centralised oracle service, there’s nothing you can do except trust Oraclize or Microsoft or whoever that the decision they make regarding which data is false, and which nodes should not be counted, is actually legit. In the case of SAA Protocol, the SAA protocol will ensure 2 tier security on different oracle service providers, depending on the bid, rank them with their reputation and come to a calculated understanding about which data is legit.
